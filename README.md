# ChatBot Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple chatbot using Python. The chatbot can interact with users, respond to predefined questions, and provide information based on user inputs.

## Features

- Basic interaction with users
- Responds to predefined questions
- Provides information based on user inputs
- Easy to extend with additional functionalities and responses

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chatbot.git
cd chatbot
```

2. Install any necessary dependencies (if any). For this basic version, no additional installations are required as it uses standard Python libraries.

## Usage

1. Run the `chatbot.py` script:

```bash
python chatbot.py
```

2. Interact with the chatbot by typing your questions or commands in the console.

## Customization

- To add more responses or customize the chatbot's behavior, modify the `responses` dictionary and the logic in the `handle_input` function in `chatbot.py`.

## Example

```python
responses = {
    "hi": "Hello! How can I help you today?",
    "bye": "Goodbye! Have a great day!",
    "help": "I am a simple chatbot. You can ask me anything!"
}

def handle_input(user_input):
    return responses.get(user_input.lower(), "I'm sorry, I don't understand that.")
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to improve the chatbot.
